## Deployment Requirements

- use python frameworks for this project
- use python uv for dependency management and build
- implement two apps inside the code base, one for API, and another for web-application

### for web application

- use python django framework for building the web application
- build the django web app in such a way that I can test on my local linux (ubuntu server) first, and later host to a cloud device

### for the API

- use python FastAPI framework to build the APIs
- use Cloudflare D1 for database storage
- use Cloudflare Workers service for hosting the service APIs
